* A Lisp for Ben Eater's 6502 computer

** Current status
Right now this lisp implementation does very little to deserve its name:

It reads and interns symbols and stores lists of symbols
in the heap (which is not a heap yet, just some allocated
memory which is never garbage-collected).

Evaluation always returns ~NIL~.

** Building
Run
: make

The image suitable for burning an EEPROM ends up in =build/lispos8.bin=.

** Developing
For a quicker turnaround you can copy-and-paste =build/lisp.woz=
into your serial console while /Wozmon/ is running (that should be
the case after a reset). Then you can start lisp using

: 0400R
